### Things to do:
 EDA: use pandas_profiling and self implementation of EDA. Ignoring pandas profiling as features are too many

 Feature Engineering: Use all the methods in playlist (transformations, cardinality, missing values, normalizations etc). 

 Feature Selection: self implementation from playlist
 Before Model Building: get best threshold (work on False Negatives), See effects of clustering

 Model Building: Check with different models
